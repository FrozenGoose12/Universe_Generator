This is a fun art project of mine. I am new to coding so I am open to any suggestions or advice. 

It works by defualt in fullscreen, just hit escape to leave exit. The actual game is the Universe_Generator.py file. The for manual files are for customizing.

It is best to play it on a regular python editor with pygame installed ("pip install pygame" in the terminal), but you can also play it online by pasting the code into: https://trinket.io/features/pygame
